# Smart Components

**Complete, prebuilt AI features for .NET apps.** (Experimental)

Smart Components makes it easier and quicker to add intelligent features to your apps. Just add ready-made UI components/controls to upgrade your existing application.

This is an experiment from the .NET app frameworks team, and is initially available for **ASP.NET Core 6.0 and later** with:

 * **Blazor** (see: [Getting started with Smart Controls and Blazor](docs/getting-started-blazor.md))
 * **MVC / Razor Pages** (see: [Getting started with Smart Controls and MVC/Razor Pages](docs/getting-started-mvc-razor-pages.md))

We may add support for other UI tech later, depending on feedback.

## What's included



## Feedback and support

The purpose of this experiment is to assess whether/how the .NET community would want to use prebuilt UI components for AI features.

**Please give us your feedback, even if it's just to say "*Yes I want this*" or "*I won't use this because...*"**. 

Smart Components isn't yet an officially supported part of .NET. Whether or not it graduates to full support depends on community feedback and usage levels.
